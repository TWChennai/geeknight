  title: "Streamlining Microservices Deployment with Monorepos"
  video_link: "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVpvoMOPNXM&list=PLH8WPOo4hnqwxiSJWZXpt7SoK8__kkU_c&index=3"
  subtitle: "Managing microservices across multiple repositories often results in fragmented workflows, complex dependency management, and inconsistent deployments. In this session, we’ll explore how a monorepo approach can reduce friction by unifying service codebases, simplifying development workflows, and improving collaboration. Through a practical demo, you’ll learn how to structure a monorepo for clarity, manage dependencies effectively, and set up streamlined CI/CD pipelines — all without sacrificing service autonomy"
