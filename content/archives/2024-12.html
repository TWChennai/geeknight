  subtitle: "Achieving high accuracy in Text-to-SQL systems is crucial for streamlining database interactions and enabling seamless data retrieval. This talk explores how dynamic few-shot prompting—a method of adaptively selecting and refining prompt examples—can dramatically enhance query generation accuracy. Attendees will learn how adaptive prompt selection and contextual learning refine model outputs, balancing precision with robust adaptability across diverse databases and schemas. By the end of the session, participants will have practical techniques to optimize SQL query generation for real-world applications, paving the way for more efficient and reliable data workflows."
