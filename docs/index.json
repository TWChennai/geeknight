        "subtitle": "Computational epigraphy is an interdisciplinary area that combines computing and the study of ancient inscriptions. The main challenge or bottleneck faced in the field of epigraphical research is the lack of standardized corpora of the ancient scripts under study. Preparing such data from raw archaeological records, requires laborious human effort, expertise and a lot of time. Machine Learning has been used in the past to reduce human effort in epigraphical research, in problems such as classification and search for graphemic patterns. However, ML and in specific Deep Learning has not been applied yet, for the complementary task of corpus preparation. This talk will be focusing on how a deep learned pipeline architecture was designed to serve as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) engine that is capable of reading the Indus script, one of the ancient and undeciphered inscriptions of the Harappan Civilization. This pipeline takes as input, images of the undeciphered Indus script, as found in archaeological artifacts, and returns as output a string of graphemes, suitable for inclusion in a standard corpus.",

        "subtitle": "Real world Software Engineering is an iterative process and one of its main objectives is to get changes all of types - including new features, configuration changes, bug fixes and experiments into production and into the hands of the users, safely, quickly and in a sustainable way. Continuous Delivery (CD), a software engineering discipline, with its principled approach allows you to solve this exact problem. The core idea of CD is to create a repeatable, reliable and incrementally improving process for taking software from concept to the end user. Like software development, building real world machine learning (ML) algorithms is an also an iterative process with a similar objective - How do I get my ML algorithms into production and in the hands of the users in a safe, quick and sustainable way. The current process of building models, testing and deploying them into production is at best an ad-hoc process in most companies.</br> At Indix, while building the Google of Products, we have had some good success in combining the best practices of continuous delivery in building our machine learning pipelines using open source tools and frameworks. The talk will not focus on the theory of ML or about choosing the right ML algorithm but specifically on the last mile problem of taking models to production and the lessons learned while applying the concept of CD to ML.. Here are some of the key questions that the talk with try to answer.</br> 1. ML Models Repository as analogous to Software Artifacts Repository - Similar to a software repository, what are the features of a Models Repository to aid traceability and reproducibility? Specifically, how do you manage models end to end - managing model metadata, visualization and lineage etc?</br> 2. ML Pipelines to orchestrate and visualize the end to end flow - A typical ML workflow has multiple stages. How do you model your entire workflow as a pipeline (similar to Build Pipeline in CD) to automate the entire process and help visualize the entire end to end flow?</br> 3. Model Quality Assurance - What quality gates and evaluation metrics, either manual and automated, should be used before exporting (promoting) models for serving in production? What happens when several different models are in play? How do you measure the models individually and then also in combination</br> 4. Serving Models in Production - How do you serve and scale these models in production? What happens when these models are heterogenous (built using different languages - Scala, Python etc.)?",

        "subtitle": "This talk is about why and how we built our internal data pipeline platform. At Indix we have data in different formats - html pages, thrift records, avro records and the usual culprits - CSVs and other plain text formats. We have data in TBs and in a few KBs and data consisting of billions of records and data consisting of a few hundred rows. And all this data - in one form or another - is consumed by the engineers, the product managers, the customer success team and even our CEO. Our biggest challenge was in knowing which data exists and where, and how to access it efficiently while balancing costs and productivity of the people involved. We had to make do with adhoc Scalding jobs. There was no single place where people can discover the different 'datasets' that we had, what format they were in, where they were stored and how frequently a new version was published. Running jobs was also not straightforward since things like finding a cluster to use were not trivial. In order to democratize the access to data and make it easy for anyone within the organization to work and play with the data we had, we went about building a data pipeline platform for our internal users. Leveraging the power of Spark, the platform allows the users to define datasets (along with their schema) and create pipelines to work with the datasets. The pipelines can be configured via a wizard based UI or a JSON config and all the jobs run on dedicated and auto scaled Spark clusters. Predefined transformations to filter, project, sample and even type in sql queries have made it powerful but simple to use for any type of user. Support for S3, Sftp and even Google sheets made it usable for different internal and customer use cases. The platform also enables us to load the same data and perform similar operations on them via notebooks with just couple of lines of client code. Today we run over 300 pipelines across over 100 datasets and thousands of versions of the datasets using this platform. The data pipeline platform has truly changed the way we ingest, manipulate, analyze and egress data across the organization, and is on course to be converted into a self-serve platform for our (external) customers too.",

They help us in building services which are scalable and eases the deployment and development process.<br/><br/>As scale rises, simple, direct http calls from service to service become bottlenecks, and cascede failures through the system. A distributed, horizontally scalable bus like Kafka becomes essential.<br/><br/>At GO-JEK, we handle 2X of India’s total food tech daily order volume. The restaurants that make the food depend on GO-RESTO, our merchant facing app.<br/><br/>As we scaled, GO-RESTO started having slow queries for displaying the complete order report for a merchant in a day. We could not delete the underlying table as the table were used by other queries. We needed to move this data and the query away from the main service to uphold our SLA.<br/><br/>In order to move this data away from the main service, we started to publish the data to Kafka. Using the Esb Generic Log Consumer that was written for streaming data from Kafka to Postgres, we were able to get the data required to the backend database of the new microservice that we were writing. Then we wrote the backend service capable of handling the queries. In the end, we were able to reduce the latencies as well as take out the load on the main service.",

        "subtitle": "The true power of GraphQL is not just its syntax but the fact that it makes it possible to think about your application in ways you’d never thought about it before. The realtime bits of GraphQL spec is one such mind-opening abstraction when you use it as a tool to think about architecting an asynchronous, event-driven backend.<br/><br/> Building backends that are asynchronous and event-driven is not easy. The rise of serverless and tooling is making the ops easy, but the larger problem around architecting an application (especially the frontend) to be ready to consume a fundamentally asynchronous backend still remains. GraphQL subscriptions and live-queries offer an opportunity to design a “reactive” contract between the backend and the frontend.<br/><br/> This talk is about how you can use the realtime bits of the GraphQL spec and the Hasura GraphQL Engine to think of the data-flow through your entire backend application. To draw on the redux analogy, GraphQL mutations are actions, your datastore is the “state”, your asynchronous business logic are the “reducers”, and GraphQL subscriptions/live-queries become the state update glue.<br/><br/> I draw on the experience of having recently built applications in this style and will go over different architecture patterns, tools used, code-samples, observed benefits, pros/cons and how this pattern fits into the larger GraphQL and serverless revolution that we are undergoing. I will also end with a small live-coding demo to show you how easy it is to plan and build a reactive application.",

Cross browser and end to end workflow testing is getting increased demand.E2E tests allow you test your application from start to finish, in ways an end user would use the application. Unit and integration tests test a pieces of code in isolation and cannot guarantee that all the pieces would work as a system. Testcafé is one of the recent arrivals in this evolution which makes testing easy in these aspect. Developer friendly, with awesomeness of Javascript library and no selenium dependency makes the tool more special.

However, that’s not an excuse to care less about the new developers or hobbyists who are getting on-boarded onto the platform. In fact, I believe that the fresh developers of today are the potential future platform evangelists. As a litmus test, a platform can be judged by it's first ‘Hello-World’ journey that it offers to a fresh developer. In a quest to analyze the adoption barriers and to make the hello-world more welcoming, I stumbled upon a really useful tool called “Glitch” which helped me to create insanely prepared boilerplates for developers to work on. Everything is already configured for the developers to start-off thus letting them validate or experience the richness of the platform upfront. I humbly present to you the story of how we reduced the setup time for our developers from several minutes to just a few seconds with Glitch!",

Scaling in Kubernetes is reactive, based on the CPU and memory consumption of a container. In contrast, services like Azure Functions are acutely aware of event sources and therefore able to scale based on signals coming directly from the event source, even before the CPU or memory is impacted. So We need to bring the benefits of event-driven architectures and the productivity of functions to Kubernetes. The result is KEDA – Kubernetes-based event-driven autoscaling. Microsoft and Red Hat partnered to build this open-source component to provide event-driven capabilities for any Kubernetes workload. KEDA enables any container to scale from zero to potentially thousands of instances based on event metrics like the length of a Kafka stream or an Azure Queue. It also enables containers to consume events directly from the event source instead of decoupling with HTTP. KEDA can drive the scale of any container and is extensible to add new event sources. It is in GA now with 1.0 release.",
